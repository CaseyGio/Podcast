# Overview

It felt wrong to require you all to create something that I had not created myself. With help from Dr. Moses Rivera, I created a podcast example that *almost* exactly meets the criteria for our assigned class podcasts. I've also shared some information below about what I do to create the podcast.

## The Podcast

Link to the podcast hosted on audio.com. You will have to use the link, the file is unlisted on that website so you cannot view it by searching for it directly.

## Reflections

These are in loosely chronological order.

### Identifying the Topic

I wanted to use the same category as the assignment: fairness and/or bias in selection. From there, I drew on my own interests (I/O grad admissions) and recall reading a very well done review article on fairness/bias in academic selection (Woo, S. E., LeBreton, J. M., Keith, M. G., & Tay, L., 2023). Starting from my own interests made it simple to find the topic. There may not be a single review that perfectly covers your topic, that's okay. Find a couple sources and figure out how to connect them into a coherent story. Much of my scientific content came from the one review article.

### Finding a Podcast Style

My first thought was to have two co-hosts (Moses and I) that had equal time talking and with equal roles. The style I ended up making was more of an interview approach wherein I talked the majority of the time and Moses asked me questions. To be transparent, I wanted to do most of the work—like writing the script—and I didn't want to force him to say all the puns or silly jokes I sprinkled in there.

### Writing a Script

This was the hardest part; I never write scripts. My writing is formal so I basically wrote a paper first and then spent editing time making it sound like words a real human would say. I also made it way too short at first so some of that editing time was wasted because I needed to write more of the script. The best tip for writing/editing the script is to spend a decent amount of time on it and then step away (likely while your partner takes a turn) for several days. Coming back with "fresh eyes" and reading the script aloud really helped make it sound more conversational.

### Recording the Podcast

Finding the software was easy. Moses and I joined a Zoom call, I hit record, and we read the transcript. This produced a few files, including the audio (.M4A file type) and the video (.MP4). I only needed the audio file.

The actual recording was harder. I was nervous to record, which is not unusual. We recorded the podcast twice. The first time was our "dry run" while we read over the script together for the first time. This allowed us to get a sense of how we will work together, we checked the file to ensure sound/audio was working, worked out the nerves, etc. The second recording was the audio I used in the ultimate podcast (we had a lot of good stuff from the first recording if we needed a different option).

**Tip**: When you make a mistake, just stop talking for a few seconds and restart that section/sentence from the beginning. We made mistakes, mispronounced words, got tripped up, forgot where we were. That was easy to edit out. Just pause for a few seconds, collect your thoughts, make a quick loud sound (e.g., clap twice, snap, click your tongue), then restart. The long pause and loud sound make it really easy to find those spots when editing. Plus the pause lets you reset and think for a moment how to redo that section/sentence.

### Before Editing (Sounds + Cover Art)

None of this was required. However, I wanted to add a few extra elements to make it feel like a real podcast. I found intro/outro music and sound effects (thunder, weird transition sound). I used either AI to create sounds or found royalty-free resources. Using AI to generate sounds was a rabbit hole of time that ultimately produced the thunderclap and "ba dum-tss" drumset sound. Those were easy to describe; creating jingles and transition sounds was a waste of time (but fun, no regrets).

I also used Microsoft's AI image tool to change a picture of Moses and I into a cartoonish graphic for our podcast with the made-up podcast title on there. This was also a time sink that had almost no value-add (again, no regrets).

### Editing the Podcast

I thought this step was going to be the hardest. It took me about two hours from downloading the (free, no trial or purchase needed) Audacity software to having an edited product. Some of that time was spent Googling "how to" details and much trial and error with the undo button.

**Software**: I used Audacity for all my sound editing. I needed to download a plugin because Zoom creates an .M4A file type and the plugin allowed me to import the Zoom audio file into Audacity.

**How I Edited**: I listened to the podcast (I know, I hate hearing myself, too) and edited everything to do with Moses and I's recording (e.g., breath sounds, "um" and "uh" sounds, long pauses). Once our sounds were fine, I added the sound effects and adjusted them according to the audio. For instance, I added space before Moses started talking to make room for the "badum tss" sound.

**Things I Edited**:
- Removed breaths, clicks of the tongue. Most of the time I either cut the sound entirely or replaced it with "silence" (in the Generate dropdown, selecting silence "creates" new empty sound).
- Removed pauses. Zoom has a slight delay between users so sometimes we had awkwardly long pauses between speakers. Sometimes I had long pauses in what I was saying. Those were cut.
- Imported audio files of each sound effect I wanted to add.
- For intro, outro, and some transition sound effects, I changed their volume and faded out the music. This was done with the "Envelope tool" and involved the most trial and error. You create control points that allow you to change the volume across two control points. All music was turned down a little bit and begins to fade at a certain point. Identify where you want it to start fading (trial and error, tinker around with different options) and make a control point. It might help to watch a video or something—I probably should have.

### My Final Thoughts

It was a fun experience and it allowed me to gain some skills that I didn't have (e.g., sound editing). I am mostly content with the final product. It's hard to hear myself talk and there are a number of small details about the script or things I said that I could spend a lifetime revising. That's fine, I was not striving for perfection. I wanted to make an example podcast that's on a similar level as what I would expect from you (e.g., production-wise).

That's it. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

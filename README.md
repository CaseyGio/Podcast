## About the Workshop

This workshop is designed to help participants learn about podcasting, including creating, editing, and publishing podcasts. Throughout the brown bag talk, participants will learn about and engage in small discussions regarding the use of podcasts in their own courses. 

## Resources

### Podcast MP3

The [podcast recording & MP3 file](https://audio.com/casey-giordano/audio/personnel-selection-podcast) is available through the Audio.com website. The podcast was edited and published through Audacity and this is the final version. Roughly 25 minutes of recorded content was cut to just under 18 min. If you are brave enough to listen to the recording, you can listen or even download it at your convenience. 

### Assessment Check-ins

The following document contains sections relating to (a) tips & resources for creating a podcast and (b) all the instructions and guidance for each check-in of the podcast throughout the semester.

### Peer Review Guidance

The document linked below was generated to facilitate a constructive and productive peer review process. It is based on the rubric created to evaluate the I/O Psychology Master's track and is therefore adopted to this (and several other) assessment in the course. I would recommend that you create a rubric that fits your needs, potentially enlisting the support of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot) to aid in generating the rubric and guiding questions.

### Caseys Reflections on the Podcast

If you are also interested, I wrote a little document to walk my students through my own process. It helps explain what software I used, how I identified the topics, what parts of sound editing I did, etc.
